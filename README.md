For different causes, fractures develop in the shoulder region, which has a more excellent range of 
motion than other joints in the body. Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) are used to identify these fractures, whereas X-ray is utilised to examine the bones. The 
purpose of this research is to aid clinicians by using artificial intelligence to categorise shoulder 
pictures obtained from X-ray machines as fracture/non-fracture. In this report, seven deep 
convolution neural network-based models are trained and built to identify the shoulder fractures 
using a modified version of the extensive MURA dataset that includes pictures of the shoulders. A 
random split was done so that the testing and training sets included 563 and 8379 photos, 
respectively. These testing and training set consist of positive (Fracture) and negative (non -
fracture). Of the 563 picture sets to be tested, there are 285 non-fracture pictures and 278 fracture 
photos. All the models are trained and compared using various performance measures, and the best 
model is selected. The ensemble model has bested all the other models with a training accuracy of 
86.25% and 77.3% validation accuracy
